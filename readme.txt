== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple plugin to add a list of your upcoming or past events in your WordPress blog. 

Besides the default title and description it contains event date, event time, event location, event URL and featured image. So no event categories or event tags. That's it.

Use shortcode [vsel] to display your upcoming events on a page.

Use shortcode [vsel_past_events] to display your past events on a page.

Question? Please take a look at the FAQ section.

Use shortcode [vsel] to display your upcoming events on a page.

Use shortcode [vsel_past_events] to display your past events on a page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I change date format in US format? =
VSEL plugin uses the European date format in frontend and backend (day/month/year). To change this into US date format (year/month/day):

For backend open folder 'js' and file 'vsel_datepicker' and change date format in: 'yy-mm-dd'.

And open file 'vsel' and change date format (2x) in: 'Y-m-d'.

For frontend open files 'vsel_shortcode' and 'vsel_past_events_shortcode' and change date format in: 'F j, Y'.

= How can I set number of events on a page? =
VSEL plugin uses the number set in WP dashboard Settings > Reading.

= Can I leave event time, event location and event URL blank?  =
Yes, event time, event location, event URL and featured image are not required fields.

= What's an event URL and how do I enter it? =
It's just a link to another website for more info. You can enter the complete URL or without the http part (the http part will be auto added if not entered).

= Can I list both upcoming and past events? =
You can list upcoming or past events in frontend using different shortcodes. 
You should not use both shortcodes on the same page.

= How do I list upcoming and past events in a template file? =
For upcoming events use this: `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[vsel]' ); ?>` 

For past events use this: `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[vsel_past_events]' ); ?>`

= Other question or comment? =
